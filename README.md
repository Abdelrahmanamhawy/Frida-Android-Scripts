# Frida-Android-Scripts
Hi, these are some scripts that i use whenever a mobile pentest task comes up . Hope they would be helpful for someone 

They are for tracing URIs , webviews,Javascript bridges and interfaces . Other scripts are for tracing a class with a specific name , launching an activity in order to bypass certain protections , hooking GUI
